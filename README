This is a working proof of concept C LED library for the alienware 15 r3 to control its LEDs through the libusb C API. It heavily draws upon code found at https://github.com/erlkonig/alienfx.

To compile the static c library, run: 

sudo make -B && sudo make install

This will allow you include an "alienfx.h" header in your code to access the library. Also be sure to complile with the lalienfx cflag and to include the libusb-1.0 library.
